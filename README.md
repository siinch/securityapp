# Programming for Security Project Spring 2020

## Introduction
This is app will feature an graphical user interface, which will allow users to create their own profiles and encrypt/decrypt the files they own. The profiles will have passwords, which will be securely stored with hashing and salts. Users will be required to use strong passwords. The files will be encrypted using the advanced encryption standard, which features symmetric encryption with cipher block chaining and initialization vectors. The symmetric keys will also be stored securely using hashing. If there is time, users may be to securely share their symmetric keys, so they can share their encrypted files.

##Security Goals
The primary purpose of this application is to allow the users to ensure the confidentiality of their files. In other terms, the information in the files should never be made available to any unauthorized entities.

#### Assignment Requirements
The assignment text 
1) The description should include a discussion of what kind of security goals are involved in the purpose (eg,confidentiality) and what threats may face the application. 
2) The description should also discuss one or more security design patterns used in the program. If the program does not use a design pattern, there should be a discussion of which design patterns you have considered (and eventually rejected).
3) The description should discuss a test of the application. Preferably this should be in the form of defining and executing a small number (say two-three) of test cases.
4) The description must use graphical or visual means of presentation. The description must include screen shots of the application (say of input and output related to testing). The description must also include at least one UML diagram, for instance a class diagram.

The source code listing (the program)
1. Clarity and sophistication of the program text.
2. You are welcome to use stubs for parts of the functionality, to reduce the programming effort.
