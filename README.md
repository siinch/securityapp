# Programming for Security Project Spring 2020
This is app will feature an graphical user interface, which will allow users to create their own profiles and encrypt/decrypt the files they own. The profiles will have passwords, which will be securely stored with hashing and salts. Users will be required to use strong passwords. The files will be encrypted using the advanced encryption standard, which features symmetric encryption with cipher block chaining and initialization vectors. The symmetric keys will also be stored securely using hashing.

If there is time, users may be to securely share their symmetric keys, so they can share their encrypted files.
